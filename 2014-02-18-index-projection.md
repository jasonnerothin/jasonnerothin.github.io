## Overview

There is a large category of computational problems that can be solved by storing a map of truth values.
Since a given value can be stored in a single bit, it is relatively cost-effective to pre-calculate values for large
combinations of [first-order logical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) constructs. Even problems
that do not appear to be formally logical in nature can be solved by trading precision in continuous variables
for an acceptably priced system in the end.

This will be accomplished in three sections:

1. Mapping 3&dash;D coordinates
2. Tracking Changes in an RDBMS
3. Using the API

We will finish with an analysis showing that storage can be substantially cheaper in the average case.

Our solution is a [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) mash-up of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics)">mathematical projection</a> with
the [distributed bitmap](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/sbp/distributed-bitmap.html) algorithm.

## Mapping 3&dash;D coordinates

### Try 1: mathematical projection
We start with a sound implementation of a mapping from a sequence of Points in 3-Dimensions to a sequence of Points on
the x-axis. Key code is shown here:

![example projection function trait](images/apply.png)
[source code](https://github.com/jasonnerothin/projectit/blob/2234fd3fd0764573e6662144a5b908815e6badd0/src/main/scala/com/jasonnerothin/project/Projection.scala)

What we have produced is a projection of all Points in 3-D to Points on the x-axis.

Now, let\'s assume that we start with the triangle given by the coordinates {(1,2,3), (1,3,4), (3,4,5)} as input:

![current design problems](images/main-problem.png)
[source code](https://github.com/jasonnerothin/projectit/blob/5c705848cfe5bf1006c84404785958673b518ae9/src/main/scala/com/jasonnerothin/project/Main.scala#L29)

The triangle is in fact projected onto the x-axis, as desired. But there is a problem. Two, actually. To demonstrate
what we need to do to get a correctly-designed projection, we've demonstrated two things wrong with our current
implementation. The first is that our projection implementation is **not**
[one-to-one](http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATP5/OntoFunctions.htm):

![not one to one](images/output0.png)
[source code](https://github.com/jasonnerothin/projectit/blob/5c705848cfe5bf1006c84404785958673b518ae9/src/main/scala/com/jasonnerothin/project/Main.scala#L29)

(1,0,0) is mapped to by (1, 2, 3) *and* (1, 3, 4). Therefore, we don\'t know how to pick the Point in 3-D that
corresponds to our Point in 1-D. Therefore, the projection is not *invertible*. Which means we cannot get our data
back out of a grid once written there.

So, let\'s update our projection so that it is both one-to-one and
[onto](http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATP5/OntoFunctions.htm):

### Try 2: An invertible projection

In this next section of code, we choose to retain all of our information in an encoded bit string (actually, it\'s
Scala\'s performant [BigInt implementation](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.10.3/index.html#scala.math.BigInt)). So
in order to get our y and z components back out, we simply keep them around in the encoded bit string:

![invertible projection](images/try2point.png)
[source code](https://github.com/jasonnerothin/projectit/blob/853b77a1e63e19a24dd11508541ad8a6a700b711/src/main/scala/com/jasonnerothin/project/Projection.scala#L79)

The output is as we\'d expect:

![getting our data back out](images/output1.png)
[source code](https://github.com/jasonnerothin/projectit/blob/853b77a1e63e19a24dd11508541ad8a6a700b711/src/test/scala/com/jasonnerothin/project/Main.scala#L29)

But we\'re not saving much (any) space!

### Try 3: Compressing the problem by reducing the co-domain

So, thus far, we\'ve pretty much just reviewed middle-school mathematics. A worthy pursuit, but let\'s save some money
by mixing in a little analysis:

Currently, we\'ve built a mechanism capable of telling us which of the points are occupied on the 3-D cartesian
coordinate system. The amount of space required for this is approximately 96-bits per occupant. Therefore, we can
completely characterize any set of Cartesian coordinates in approximately 1/10 kb times the size of the set, *as long as
all members of that have no x, y, or z component larger than Int.MaxValue*.

But *what if* we simply kept doing our homework with values much smaller than Int.MaxValue? Like, say, less than 2^10?
Well, then we'd be down to the size of the set times 30 bits!

VoilÃ !
