I attempt in this work to demonstrate that new earth creationism is bad theology.

I will start by telling a short parable and later speaking more directly, so that you may better understand my meaning.
 
###### The Parable
A quick [search](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=cheesecake&qs_version=KJV) has proven definitively that there is no recipe for cheesecake in the Bible. 

Other comestibles: Milk? Yes. Honey? Definitely. Cheese? Of course. Creepy crawly things? Why yes! Even a place for that.
 
But still there is not a single mention of the emminently glorious cheesecake, let alone a good recipe.

###### Notes to my readers:

- Along the way, I was taught to write with various means depending upon the intended audience {because it is obvious that one should be spoken to on the sole basis of the seat they choose to sit in}. 
- In none of the following am I an expert: Exegesis, ~~politics~~, scientific writing, technical documentation, marketing, philosphy, social media, prose or (least of all) poetry. Nevertheless, I tend toward prose, with its allusions, shades of meaning, neerdowell humor, and so on. Every time I have tried to write naturally, the literalists have punished me with fury. Usually with their silent indifference (bewilderment?), but sometimes more helpfully with a clarifying question.
- For clarity, I will typeface my words according to their intended effect: **strictly literal**, _whimsical/tangential_, ``logical/mathematical``. Lack of special font face indicates the natural form (i.e. a bit prosey).
- I stubbornly refuse to foist footnotes upon you. It's an original sin of non-literary proprotions. Instead we shall use [brackets] for this and {curlies} for digression.
- Politics will be discussed while violating the First Commandment Of Web Development: The blink tag must never, ever, ever be used.
    
###### Deuteronomy 29:29
 
> The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

###### On Language

It is generally held amongst Muslim theologians that Allah choose Arabic as a perfect language to convey his new dispensation through The Prophet. With the Torah, we are less constrained. God chose Hebrew and its alphabet more prosaically. Although its alphabet is a practical choice for its ability to preserve meaning across generations.

The curiousness of these situations has always struck me. Anyone who has ever communicated by ancient means like email should readily understand that text-only communication is akin to communicating by smoke signal. Binary information - Troy has fallen - has a succint enough representation. Troop movements and tales of heroism? Little chance.
