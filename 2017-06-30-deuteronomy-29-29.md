I will start by telling a short parable and later speaking more directly, so that you may understand my meaning.
 
###### The Parable
A quick Bible Gateway search has proven definitively that there is no recipe in the Bible for cheesecake. 

Mention of other comestibles? Milk? Yes. Honey? Definitely. Cheese? Of course. Creepy crawly things? Why yes! Even a place for that.
 
But still there is not a single mention of the emminently glorious cheesecake, let alone a good recipe.

###### Notes to my readers:

- Along the way, I was taught to write in various ways depending upon audience. In none of the following am I an expert: Exegesis, scientific writing, technical documentation, marketing, philosphy, social media, prose or (least of all) poetry. Nevertheless, I tend toward prose with its allusions, shades of meaning, neerdowell humor, and so on. Every time I have tried to write naturally, the literalists have punished me with fury. Usually with their silent indifference (bewilderment?), but sometimes more helpfully with a clarifying question.
- For clarity, I will typeface my words according to their intended effect: **strictly literal**, _whimsical/tangential_, ``logical/mathematical``. Lack of special font face indicates the natural form (i.e. interpret as a bit prosy).

###### Deuteronomy 29:29
 
> The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
